            		<p>Join us in Arlington, VA on April 27 for an Information Day regarding the Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program. <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1b8Z-tdLH5p8OuelCxGkuV_k70ah4DuAckp3ikvvFiXI/viewform?edit_requested=true">Register Today!</a></strong></p>
            	</div>

            	<p>
            	The Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program is a joint effort by the National Science Foundation and a wireless Industry Consortium to create city-scale testing platforms to accelerate fundamental research on wireless communication and networking technologies. The PAWR Project Office (PPO) is managing this $100 million public-private partnership to stand-up and oversee these eventual testing platforms. The PPO is run by <a target="_blank" class="default" href="http://usignite.org"><span>US Ignite, Inc.</span></a>, and <a href=" http://www.coe.neu.edu"><span>Northeastern University</span></a>.
            	</p>

                <p>The PPO will collaborate closely with NSF, the wireless research community, local communities, and industry in the design, development, deployment, and initial operations of the research platforms. PAWR will enable experimental exploration of robust new wireless devices, communication techniques, networks, systems, and services that will revolutionize the nation’s wireless ecosystem, thereby enhancing broadband connectivity, leveraging the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), and sustaining US leadership and economic competitiveness for decades to come.</p>

                <p>Once deployed, the platforms will address pre-competitive research challenges on at-scale research platforms, increasing education about wireless technologies and data networking, increasing academic-industry cooperative partnerships, and accelerating technology commercialization and transfer from academia to industry. In short, PAWR is designed to help overcome the so-called “valley of death” that sometimes limits breakthrough technology advancements.</p>

                 <p style="margin: 50px auto; text-align: center;" ><a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}awt/images/Valley-of-Death-ci3hn.png" class="default hover-open" target="_blank"><img  src="{{ STATIC_URL }}awt/images/Valley-of-Death-ci3hn.png" alt="Valley of Death"/></a></p>

                <p>Participating companies will benefit by: helping to sustain US industry leadership; shaping design of research platforms; and securing cutting-edge research returns well in excess of initial investment. Participating communities will benefit by: building core wireless capabilities through creative university partnerships; attracting government and corporate research funding and local wireless jobs; and utilizing advanced wireless capabilities to enhance city services and economic development.</p>

	                <h2>About</h2>
	                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Why Now? </strong>Over the last decade, the use of wireless, Internet-connected devices (e.g., smart phones, connected tablets, and wearables) in the United States has nearly doubled. As the momentum of this exponential growth continues, the transfer of ever-increasing amounts of data intensifies Internet traffic, and the need for increased capacity grows.</p>

	                <ul class="list" data-content="1" style="margin-top: 25px;">
						<li>Increases in Internet traffic place never-before-imagined demands on conventional 4G LTE networks and public WiFi networks, which may not be able to keep pace with the growing demand.</li>

						<li>Wireless carriers, device and equipment vendors, and researchers around the world are looking toward the next generation of wireless technologies (popularly called ‘5G’) and beyond to support this unparalleled growth in devices and traffic.</li>

						<li>Over the last year, a new Industry Consortium comprising more than 25 leading networking vendors, device manufacturers, and wireless carriers has been established to support the PAWR effort, garnering approximately $50 million in cash and in-kind contributions.</li>

						<li>Last year, the United States became the first country in the world to make vast quantities of high-frequency millimeter wave spectrum – frequencies that have the ability to send large amounts of data quickly but that don’t travel as far as the lower-frequency waves used today in 4G networks – available for both licensed and unlicensed use.</li>

						<li>This newly available millimeter wave spectrum, in combination with other spectrum already available, promises to enable faster speeds and increased capacity in future wireless networks.</li>

						<li>Research conducted on PAWR platforms will advance robust new wireless devices, communication techniques, networks, systems, and services that will revolutionize the Nation’s wireless ecosystem.</li>

						<li>PAWR will enable rapid commercialization of promising technologies, provide hands-on practical training to a new generation of graduate students, increase job opportunities, and support overall economic vitality.</li>

						<li>The results from this effort will sustain US leadership and economic competitiveness in wireless communications and technology for the next decade and beyond.</li>

	                <ul class="list" data-content="2" style="margin-top: 25px;">

						<li>The PPO, in conjunction with the PAWR Industry Consortium and NSF, is developing a Request for Proposals (RFP) that will call for teams of communities and research universities to propose the design, development, deployment, and initial operations of multiple platforms for advanced wireless research across the country. For academic or municipal leaders interested in submitting a PAWR proposal, we anticipate hosting a Proposers’ Day in the Washington, DC, area after the PAWR RFP is announced. If you are interested, please fill out the form in the “Get Involved” section of this site and we will notify you when registration for that event is available.</li>

						<li>The PPO anticipates re-issuing the RFP annually on an as-needed basis and subject to the availability of funds to reflect the nature of the contributions from the PAWR Industry Consortium and planned investment by NSF. It is anticipated that the PPO will have annual deadlines for submission during each of the first three years (i.e., 2017, 2018, and 2019).</li>

						<li>Each year, following receipt of proposals in response to the RFP, the PPO will run a merit review process, comparable to that of NSF, to evaluate the submitted proposals. </li>

						<li>The awardees of the RFP will be selected based on the merit review process, in consultation with NSF and the PAWR Industry Consortium. </li>

						<li>Selected awardees of the RFP will be sub-awardees of the PPO.</li>

						<li>The announcement of the subawardees for the first research platforms is anticipated in early 2018. The location(s) of the platform(s) will be announced at that time.</li>

						<li>It is anticipated that the first set of platforms for advanced wireless research will be available for use by late 2019 or early 2020. </li>

	                </p>

					<ul class="list" data-content="50" style="margin-top: 25px;">
						<li>The PPO is responsible for allocating and managing time for experimentation on the platforms for advanced wireless research.</li>

						<li>The allocation of time will be shared equally between industry and NSF-supported academic researchers and will be complementary. Allocations to NSF-supported researchers will advance fundamental knowledge in the long term, while allocations to industry researchers will accelerate nearer-term research and development activities.</li>

						<li>NSF anticipates issuing a solicitation calling for proposals from the academic community to support basic research on the platforms by early 2020.</li>

						<span data-content="5"><br><br><em>Designing, developing, deploying, and operating the platforms for advanced wireless research:</em><br><br></span>

						<ul class="list" data-content="5">
							<li>Within less than four months of its establishment (i.e., from March 8), the PPO will develop a Request for Proposals (RFP) calling for teams of communities and research universities to propose the design, development, deployment, and initial operations of multiple platforms for advanced wireless research across the country. For academic researchers or municipal leaders interested in submitting a PAWR proposal, we anticipate hosting a Proposers’ Day in the Washington, DC, area after the PAWR RFP is announced. If you are interested, please fill out the form in the “Get Involved” section of this site to <a href="#" class="default" data-goto="get-involved">join our mailing list</a>. and we will notify you when registration for that event is available</li>
							<li>The PPO anticipates re-issuing the RFP annually on an as-needed basis and subject to the availability of funds to reflect the nature of the contributions from the PAWR Industry Consortium and planned investment by NSF. It is anticipated that the PPO will have annual deadlines for submission during each of the first three years (i.e., 2017, 2018, and 2019).</li>
							<li>Each year, following receipt of proposals in response to the RFP, the PPO will run a merit review process, comparable to that of NSF, to evaluate the submitted proposals. </li>
							<li>The awardees of the RFP will be selected based on the merit review process, in consultation with NSF and the PAWR Industry Consortium. </li>
							<li>Selected awardees of the RFP will be sub-awardees of the PPO.</li>
							<li>The announcement of the subawardees for the first research platforms is anticipated early next year (2018). The location(s) of the platform(s) will be announced at that time.</li>
							<li>It is anticipated that the first set of platforms for advanced wireless research will be available for use by late 2019 or early 2020.</li>

						<ul data-content="5" class="list">
							<li>
							The PPO is responsible for allocating and managing time for experimentation on the platforms for advanced wireless research.</li>
							<li>The allocation of time will be shared equally between industry and NSF-supported academic researchers and will be complementary. Allocations to NSF-supported researchers will advance fundamental knowledge in the long term, while allocations to industry researchers will accelerate nearer-term research and development activities.</li>
							<li>NSF anticipates supporting the academic community to conduct fundamental research atop the  platforms beginning in  early 2020.</li>
							<li>Funding for research on top of the platforms will be separate from the funding for the platforms.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a class="default" data-toggle="6"> How would you characterize the research platforms and how many will there be?</a>

						<span data-content="6"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="6" class="list">
							<li>We anticipate 4 locations focusing on mid-sized cities or mid-sized areas within larger cities.</li>
							<li>The research platforms will be built on software-defined radios – devices capable of operating across multiple radio frequencies and connected via a programmable back-end network infrastructure with access to high-speed network connectivity such as Internet2 or other backhaul (i.e., not production networks).</li>
							<li>Researchers will be able to take advantage of the multi-use capability of the research platform by “plugging in” additional experimental technologies.</li>
							<li>RFPs will seek proposed platforms that have the capability to support a minimum number of research topic areas (e.g., mmWave, Dynamic Spectrum, Architecture) plus other topic areas as proposed by respondents.</li>
							<li>Proposed experimental research platforms will allow researchers to validate cutting-edge technologies (e.g., radio layer, protocol, sensors, core architecture), spectrum usage paradigms, application performance, and/or service behavior.</li>

						<a class="default" data-toggle="7">What are some of the platform research topics likely to be? How fixed are these vs. open to change or modification?</a>

						<span data-content="7"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="7" class="list">
							<li>There will be a minimum of 6-7 likely platform research topics, each spanning a broad research area. Note that we intend for these research platforms to enable fundamental, pre-competitive research on topics that will support advanced wireless networking innovations, along with potential competitive research led by members of the industry consortium.</li>
							<li>These topics are not fixed; the expectation is that PIs, industry, and communities will be able to refine and add to these research topics to ensure that they benefit the US wireless ecosystem. Topics may include:<br><br>

						<span data-content="8"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="8" class="list">
							<li> Given the focus on pre-competitive research, we expect the outcomes from these research platforms to feed into corporate/private testbeds that focus on competitive research and associated intellectual property (IP) attributes.</li>

It is anticipated that each subsequently-funded research platform will comprise a city-university team; this team may also involve corporate partners, FFRDCs, and federal labs. Similarly, FFRDCs and federal labs may participate in conducting experiments on the eventual research platforms. However, note that NSF funding to FFRDCs and federal labs is provided only under unique circumstances, as specified in NSF’s Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (see <a href="https://nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg17_1/index.jsp).">https://nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg17_1/index.jsp).</a>).

							<li>Yes, staying current with rapidly evolving technologies will be essential to the long-term utility and success of the research platforms, including sustenance.

						<span data-content="14"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="14" class="list">
							<li>Consideration will be given to the positive impacts of a given research platform on the community proposing to host it – not only in terms of potential pilot deployments of advanced technologies, but also with respect to jobs, workforce development, and economic competitiveness, for example. This consideration will take place in the context of the core focus of the research platforms (i.e., to support fundamental, pre-competitive research with the goal of quickly identifying technologies with potential commercialization opportunities). Please note that provision of commercial-grade local community services is not an immediate goal of the PAWR effort.</li>

						<ul data-content="84" class="list">
							<li>There are several problems of interest to rural areas that a small city/community may consider tackling as part of a research platform. However, as a critical mass of individuals is needed to test the research platforms (specific user densities are required to validate any testing), small cities/communities must demonstrate the presence of appropriate user densities that the follow-on research may require as part of the corresponding proposal. The emphasis is on city-scale, rather than ‘city size’.</li>

						<span data-content="18"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="18" class="list">
							<li>As with any system, there will be a learning curve – but it is anticipated that the research platforms will have staff and tutorials to assist users and mitigate this learning curve. Past efforts such as GENI and related CISE research infrastructure projects have demonstrated that providing active user support is critical to ensuring widespread user adoption.</li>
							
						</ul>

					<li>
						<a class="default" data-toggle="19">  Should we only think about short-term (three years or less until commercialization) projects to evaluate on the research platforms envisioned in the PAWR: PPO program solicitation?</a>

						<span data-content="19"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="19" class="list">
							<li>Certainly not. The research platforms are meant to support fundamental, pre-competitive academic research, for which impacts may very well be realized 10 or more years into the future, i.e., well beyond the typical three-year duration of an NSF research grant.</li>
							
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a class="default" data-toggle="20"> Do you envision following an approach by which experiments to be run on the research platforms are vetted in some way to determine their suitability?</a>

						<span data-content="20"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="20" class="list">
							<li>Yes. Proposals will be reviewed by a Research Committee (of which the PPO is a member) to ensure research conducted on the platforms aligns with the goals of the PAWR program. Details of the criteria and process will be established by the PPO in consultation with NSF, the Industry Consortium, and relevant academic/community stakeholders. </li>
							
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a class="default" data-toggle="21"> Is there a general sense of the geographic area to be covered by these research platforms (i.e., how large they should be)?</a>

						<span data-content="21"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="21" class="list">
							<li> The answer to this question may vary depending on the goals and scope of each individual research platform. For a given research platform, the geographic area will be a function of the type of wireless networks that the research platform will feature, the scale of the networks, and the effort involved in setting up and maintaining a research platform of that scale.</li>
							
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a class="default" data-toggle="22">  Are there any expectations as far as open interfaces for the research platforms?</a>

						<span data-content="22"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="22" class="list">
							<li> The intent is for the research platforms to feature both open hardware and open software interfaces, and to be reusable by others.</li>
							
						</ul>
					</li>

					

					<li>
						<a class="default" data-toggle="24">In what spectrum bands are the research platforms expected to operate, and will there be a need for licensing?</a>

						<span data-content="24"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="24" class="list">
							<li>We expect the research platforms to use a diverse set of spectrum bands depending on the types of wireless networks to be supported. These can be anywhere between 300 MHz to 200 GHz. We expect the research platform proposers to be aware of the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) spectrum policies: the FCC has created a new Program Experimental License that will allow for testing on a wide swath of frequencies. Proposers are expected to obtain such licenses and include these as part of their proposals to validate the feasibility of the proposed research platforms to work in the bands to be supported. The FCC website for receiving applications to this new Experimental License is expected to be online by the time the proposals for platforms are due. Specifically, as of March 8, 2017, the FCC has stated, “The FCC is in final beta testing of it new program license system.   The new program license will allow qualified licensees to simply post proposed experiments on an FCC website for implementation over a defined geographic area under control of the licensee.  If no objections to the experiment are received within a 10 to 15 day comment period, the licensee is authorized to proceed.  This avoids a typical 4 to 6 week processing period and allows all interested parties including licensed stakeholders to be aware of proposed experiments of interest.  In addition, the program license also supports use of Innovation Zones, innovation areas defined by industry or the Commission, which similarly permits innovators to proceed with experiments after posting a 10 to 15 day notice.  The intent of the program license is to permit sources of innovation such as universities and R&D institutions to more quickly move forward with experiments.  The FCC expects to release the system shortly upon completion of beta testing.”</li>

						<a class="default" data-toggle="25">Can one do research on the design and development of the research platforms, or only as part of research projects to be enabled by the research platforms? 
</a>

						<span data-content="25"><br><br></span>

						<ul data-content="25" class="list">
							<li> A mix of both is anticipated. These research platforms constitute research infrastructures for the wireless networking and communications research community. As the research platforms mature over time, they will support less research in the design and development aspects and more research as a result of the availability of the infrastructure.</li>

							<li> PAWR is an open, pre-competitive, fundamental research effort. Both the PAWR Industry Consortium and NSF seek to explore a multitude of research concepts through these research platforms. There are no formal expectations of commercialization, but such outcomes would be encouraged as an end product. </li>

							<li>The research platforms are expected to serve the research communities for a decade or more, but the individual research projects that will be conducted on the research platforms can be short-, medium-, and/or long-term.
