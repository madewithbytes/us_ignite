GCTC organizers will then review the worksheet and send feedback to the team lead. When GCTC and the team lead agree on a final worksheet, the Action Cluster will be officially created. Each Action Cluster will be given::

            <ol>
                <li>A free exhibition/demonstration space at the Expo (June 13-14) and a speaking slot. The priorities of the speaking slot will be given to the teams that show working demonstrations and/or pilot deployments at the Expo as part of the exhibition</li>

            <p>The requirements to form an Action Cluster are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Each team needs to have more than 1 entity.</li>
                <li>Each team should have at least one municipal government participant, which will deploy the solution. (At least one city official should actively participate in the team.)</li>
                <li>At the GCTC Expo in June 2016, the municipal government partner should participate and be part of the team presentation. Each team should demonstrate the feasibility of their project at the Expo by exhibiting prototypes, pilots, and/or preliminary results.</li>
                <li>Each team should plan to deploy and report the project’s measurable/quantifiable impact to the residents by June 2017 and demonstrate the result at the 2017 Expo.</li>
                <li>Optional: Teams are encouraged to have multiple municipal partners deploying the same project.</li>

            <h3>Potential Funding Opportunities</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) has published the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505364">Smart & Connected Communities (S&CC)</a> program solicitation, spanning the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE); Education and Human Resources (EHR); Engineering (ENG); Geosciences (GEO); and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).</p>
            <p>The goal of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505364">S&CC program</a> solicitation is to support strongly interdisciplinary, integrative research and research capacity-building activities that will improve understanding of smart and connected communities and lead to discoveries that enable sustainable change to enhance community functioning. The solicitation calls for proposals that include clearly articulated community engagement. For the purposes of this year’s solicitation, communities are considered physical, geographically-defined entities, such as towns, cities, or incorporated rural areas, often consisting of diverse, and varied populations, with a governance structure and the ability to engage in meaningful ways with the proposed research. This S&CC solicitation will support research projects in four categories: Integrative Research Grants (IRGs) Track 1, IRGs Track 2, S&CC Research Coordination Networks (RCNs), and Planning Grants. It should be noted that preliminary proposals are required for IRGs Track 1 and Track 2 only and are due November 30, 2016.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>GCTC Timeline:</h3>
            <br>

            <p>Collaboration is the most important aspect in the smart city and Internet of Things (IoT) landscape today. It's time to roll up our sleeves and work together to bring collaboration within the GCTC to the next level. We will start this challenging but exciting journey in less than 3 weeks at the Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) SuperCluster Kickoff Event.</p>

            <p>We hope you will join us in Washington DC on October 25-26 for the GCTC SuperCluster Launch Event. Please note that the upcoming deadline for hotel reservations at a preferred rate is October 10, 2016.</p>

            <p>To reserve a hotel room, please use the following link: <br><a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/go/EnergeticsIncorporated">https://resweb.passkey.com/go/EnergeticsIncorporated</a></p>

            <p>At the event, we plan to have engaging speakers and working sessions. We expect every attendee to have the opportunity to provide input into the creation of successful GCTC Superclusters with real-world impact and scale. SuperCluster working sessions will be led by conveners from communities including Portland, OR, Atlanta, GA, Newport News, VA, Columbus, OH, Bellevue, WA and Kansas City (KS & MO) and cluster partners AT&T, CH2M, IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, Urban-X, and Verizon. There will also be opportunities for local governments and their partners – including those localities that have not previously participated in GCTC – to join multi-city, IoT deployment projects in sectors such as transportation, public safety and energy.</p>

            <p>An impressive lineup of speakers and representatives from existing GCTC Action Clusters includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sophie Shulman, Senior Policy Advisor, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Transportation</li>
                <li>Vinay Singh, Senior Advisor, Urbanization & Infrastructure, U.S. Department of Commerce</li>
