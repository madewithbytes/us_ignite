                The Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) is a collaborative platform enabling local governments, nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, technologists and private corporations from all over the world to form project teams, or “Action Clusters”, in order to work on groundbreaking Internet of Things (IoT) applications within the smart city environment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Action Clusters can be formed at GCTC events, like the recent Global City Teams Challenge Kick-off, which took place on November 12th and 13th in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  <a href="https://www.us-ignite.org/globalcityteams/actioncluster/add/">Action Clusters</a> can also form online, utilizing the GCTC website and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8285610/">LinkedIn groups</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="bold">For anyone interested in joining the GCTC, please consider three potential next steps:</p>
            <br>
 
            <p>
                Contact the team leader for one or more of the proposed GCTC Action Clusters (link to list). Many of the action cluster pages on the GCTC website include contact information you can use to connect with any of the proposed Action Clusters. If you would like to connect with a team and do not see team lead information, please contact <a href="mailto:mariya.cherk@us-ignite.org">mariya.cherk@us-ignite.org</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Submit a GCTC project proposal. To do so, please complete this project worksheet and send it to <a href="mailto:sokwoo.rhee@nist.gov">sokwoo.rhee@nist.gov</a> and <a href="mailto:william.maguire@us-ignite.org">william.maguire@us-ignite.org</a>.

            <p class="bold">Why Participate in the GCTC?</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Establishing a new or joining an existing GCTC Action Cluster provides an opportunity to showcase your organization’s IoT leadership and can help get your project noticed.  It can also give you access to resources and opportunities to be provided by GCTC’s corporate and government partners.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Communities and Cities:</strong> Bring a challenge your city or community seeks to overcome to the GCTC. Participation in the GCTC allows communities to develop solutions with leaders in the IoT/smart city field and to promote their project’s “secret sauce” to other communities.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Corporations and Academic Institutions:</strong> Deploy and test IoT solutions in local government testbeds. Partner with local governments in innovative public-private partnerships. Use the GCTC platform to showcase the measurable impact of your technologies, expertise and solutions.

                <em>Interested in learning more about what leading government agencies and private sector organizations are doing to advance smart city initiatives?</em>
                <br>
                At the November Kick-off, 27 speakers represented government agencies, non-profits organizations and the private sector presented to attendees about smart city initiatives. If you missed any of these presentations, you can catch up here.  Copies of the slides that the plenary speakers used in their presentations can be found here.

         	The Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) is a collaborative network of project teams, or “Action Clusters,” working on groundbreaking Internet of Things (IoT) applications within the smart city/community environment.

            <p>
                 Action Clusters are most often composed of representatives from local governments, nonprofits, academic institutions and private corporations.  GCTC Action Clusters must include representatives from at least two organizations and at least one of the organizations participating in an Action Cluster must be a local government.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Action Clusters form at GCTC <a href="{{ SITE_URL}}/globalcityteams/events">events</a> and via the www.globalcityteams.org website. On a volunteer basis, the teams collaborate to build, deploy and test groundbreaking IoT applications.  During the first round of the GCTC, more than 60 Action Clusters composed of more than 200 organizations and involving 50+ cities from 10 countries presented at the culminating event on June 1, 2015.

	         	On November 12, 2015, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and US Ignite will launch the next round of the GCTC.  We do so with a diverse array of Partners and Participating Organizations from the public, private and non-profit sectors.
